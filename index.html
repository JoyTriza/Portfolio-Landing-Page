                    <p class="lh-3 fs-3 rithi">I am a perceptive and logical software engineer, community manager, and machine learning enthusiast with proven ability to communicate with both technical team and end users to identify and translate business requirements into functional applications.

                        I started learning to code during my first years in campus, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus after which I realized software engineering was the right field for me. I like to solve problems. Throughout my career, i have been driven by intellectual curiosity to find solutions to the most pressing problems.
                        
                        I’ve worked on countless freelance projects and have been involved with a handful of notable startups such as the ladies of LuxTech Academy which is anchored in the principle of human dignity, and advances gender equality, social inclusion and shared prosperity of women in Tech Ecosystem. I am a strong advocate for female in tech which is why i am also a Global Ambassador at WomenTechNetwork,
                        
                        Today, I’m working as a freelance software Engineer and Volunteer Technical instructor with the amazing team at Lux Tech Academy and am getting into machine learning on my own time.
                        
                        I’m familiar with a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript, Typescript HTML, CSS, Python,, jQuery, and ReactJs, MySQL, MongoDB and WordPress, but I’m always adding new skills to my repertoire. I’m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!
